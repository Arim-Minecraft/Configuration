# TheServer

Parts of the actual Arim server under development or configuration.
None of this is actually used in production, it's merely here to help us collaborate.

### Why public?

Well, for one, it's easier to work with and has no limits.
More importantly, however, it doesn't hurt us to make this public.

I (A248) once had a conversation with another user over Discord.
The user wanted me to add premium functionality to a free plugin I was contributing to.
I told the user I would add the requested features, but the changes would be open for anyone to use.

Here's what I told him:

> Consider that it does not really help you to restrict others' benefit. If someone else benefits, you do not lose.
Rather, if you benefit, and someone else benefits, you both benefit
