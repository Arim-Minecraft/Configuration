# TheServer

Parts of the actual Arim server under development or configuration.
None of this is actually used in production, it's merely here to help us collaborate.

Well, for one, it's easier to work with and has no repository limits.
More importantly, however, it doesn't hurt us to make this public.

> Consider that it does not really help you to restrict others' benefit. If someone else benefits, you do not lose.
Rather, if you benefit, and someone else benefits, you both benefit
